# configure-ad-2

Part 2

Turn on the DC-1 and Client-1 VMs in the Azure Portal if they are off.
Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
—
Log into Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin
Open system properties
Click “Remote Desktop”
Allow “domain users” access to remote desktop
You can now log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user now
Normally you’d want to do this with Group Policy that allows you to change MANY systems at once (maybe a future lab)


Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users
—
Login to DC-1 as jane_admin
Open PowerShell_ise as an administrator
Create a new File and paste the contents of the script into it
Run the script and observe the accounts being created
When finished, open ADUC and observe the accounts in the appropriate OU　(_EMPLOYEES)
attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the accounts (take note of the password in the script)

Finish the lab, but do not delete the VMs in Azure. We will use them for upcoming labs.
If you are done for the day and want to save money, simply “Stop”/turn off the VMs within the Azure Portal
